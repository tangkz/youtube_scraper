recently a new macd indicator is making
some noise on YouTube this indicator is
based on Dr Elder work where he used it
in his system which called impulse macd
system the indicator is a little bit
different than the regular macd and of
course after seeing those videos I
thought I should test this the right way
and not the crappy way now I've done a
couple of videos on macd and the most
important one is the one in the algo
versus crap series and you can watch
that over here so before we jump into
the testing let's see the regular macd
and how we can use it to build strategy
