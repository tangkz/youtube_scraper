so why trade a portfolio instead of a
really good single strategy there is no
single strategy that will perform all
the time just like a team in any sports
you need multiple talents multiple
skills to pick up the load in certain
Dynamics for example a strategy that
performs really well in volatile markets
most likely will not do so good in quiet
market so instead of dropping that
strategy as not good instead you should
pair it with a strategy that does really
well in quiet markets so this is the
concept of a portfolio multiple
strategies that does well in different
market regimes so a portfolio approach
spreads your risk across different
strategies giving you more stability and
the potential for profit in everchanging
market conditions
