today I want to discuss a strategy that
trades the indexes in fact his RSI 2
strategy really is the Holy Grail of all
strategies it's the RSI 2 this is a
daily time frame well if the RSI goes
below 30 and the close is above the
200-day moving average then we buy
and we can see this is the equity curve
so while I'm using the RSI above 70 as a
threshold to exit the trade Larry
Connors in his book he actually
dedicated a full chapter to multiple
exits so let's bring this here this
method used the adx to exit the trade
