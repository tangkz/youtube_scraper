the pattern that I found is that the S P
500 usually have a one big range day
every month this big range definition of
course has many interpretation but
usually it's a big range you can easily
spot it on a chart and you can easily
quantify that so here at the bottom I
have an indicator that plots a bar
whenever it finds this pattern so the
way I defined this big range day is
whenever the bar range
is double the range of the previous bar
plus the same bar is greater than one
and a half time the average true range
of the last 20 bucks once you put that
definition in then we have these bars
and as you can see it's not every month
but on average it's about once a month
