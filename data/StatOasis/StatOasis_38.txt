if you trade any Market enough time and
you pay attention then you'll definitely
find some patterns that repeat over time
when I used to trade the S P 500
manually I picked up on a pattern that
happens about once a month the pattern
that I found is that the S P 500 usually
have a one big range day every month
this big range definition of course has
many interpretation and you can easily
quantify that we can see almost the same
odds exist on the NASDAQ where 31 of the
events are up and the rest are down same
thing for EMD same thing for Dao this is
soybeans and we can see soybeans has
more updates than down days but again we
see the flip next day Where The Down
usually have 80 chance of flipping to up
