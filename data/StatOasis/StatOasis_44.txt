volume is a big part in every Trader
Arsenal I know some traders who only use
volume to take their trades they have
volume profile as algo traders of course
we have to test everything we read we
hear we watch and so in this video I
will try to see if volume has any effect
on strategies the next test we will do
is if the volume is increasing for the
last three bucks now we're making again
same number of Trades 430 trades but now
our average trade is amazing this is
definitely an abstract that can cover
everything you throw at it and if we
look at the strategy performance now we
are making
189 thousand dollars with 53 000
drawdown so that's four to one return to
maximum strategy drawdown
