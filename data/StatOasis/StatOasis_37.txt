about 10 years ago through my research
on the S P 500 I found a small Edge and
I built a trading strategy around it
that I used to trade it manually so this
is how I Quantified the pattern which is
when today's range is at least double
the previous range and also today's
range is greater than one and a half
times the average true range of the last
20 bucks this is an extremely nice stat
which is if we have an update the
probability that the next bar is up is
13 so here are the two strategies
combined it's a total of 173 trades and
we're making 270 on average both the
short and long are making good money and
we have more trades on the short side
and this is how the strategy looks like
which is really good we're going up all
the time
