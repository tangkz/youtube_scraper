before I do any testing I will show you
how the S P 500 drifts up every day and
it is behind the reason why I will only
go long in the testing the test I will
do is we buy every day at the open and
we sell at the club this is the result
of the test for the past 17 years and we
can look at the trades we have
4259 trades that's all the days
basically available and on average
you're making 19 this is buying every
day at the open selling at the close
this is very important point to take in
for every Market you need to test if the
market has a tendency to go up or to go
down or do nothing because basically
then you can match the style of the
strategy to that market this test just
proves that the S P 500 tends to drift
up all the time
