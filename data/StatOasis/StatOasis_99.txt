I think last time I checked it we had almost 200 
000 users and I think StrategyQuant is a way  
ahead in many important areas regarding the use 
of the data I think it's a very tough question I  
mean uh we would definitely need to take AI 
into account but there might be some issues  
with privacy and ownership like Mario said and 
I completely agree with that I'm more thinking  
of AI implementation the form for example for 
for seasonality earnings models or using AI  
basically as a filter for some fundamental 
news and so on so as we are developing this  
project this project for probably for two years 
and we are making the long list of those like  
say let's say those uncommon situations for 
example the simple rule if the ranking will  
be always one which might happen the indicator 
will return always one I think competition is  
is good for customers and not good for us as 
company it would be best for us if we have a  
monopoly on everything but I'm a Believer in free 
market and competition is what drives quality up  
we are the best strategy context is a data 
mining package you can use it to build your  
own algorithmic strategies on autopilot based 
on your instructions I've been using it for  
the past three and a half years and since 
then I wanted to interview the team behind  
it and finally we made it happen here 
is the interview and I hope you enjoy
okay so my name is Mark Fric I am the founder of 
StrategyQuant and to say something about the history  
I started the StrategyQuant in 2011 and the 
name was at the time was genetic Builder not  
StrategyQuant  the reason I started it was I was 
actively trading at the time and uh I was always  
more interested in the programming side of the 
trading not the actual Trading and uh I read about  
the idea of getting strategies generated by the 
computer in some forum and I thought that I would  
do it for my own use and when I had it I decided 
to simply try to offer it online to see if there  
is interest in this kind of tool so I've created 
a website and started to sell it and this is the  
start of StrategyQuant so you were a programmer 
since the start oh oh yes I started a computer  
science I was a programmer I was working as 
a programmer before and later as a console ID  
Consultant as I said I was always interested in 
the programming side of the things when did you  
think uh or when when did the other programmers 
joined in when did you start to need help or  
did you get a bunch of programmers from the 
beginning uh it started slowly I was uh just  
myself alone at the beginning at the beginning 
and uh I got the first programmer I think  
in the first year sometimes around the first year 
uh then I got some one one person for support  
a first year and we slowly Grew From that so I 
guess that brings us to Cornell uh when did you  
Cornell join oh I actually don't know exactly here 
it's quite long ago I think it's about seven years  
and uh firstly I started as a as a support 
member answering the tickets I'm about to  
step by step company grow up also and so 
right now I'm more focused on strategy development  
and particularly on the newest project which 
is this Algo Cloud so this is like what  
I'm spending the most of time now is is algo 
Cloud also written in Java or in different  
language yeah it is written in a typescript in 
JavaScript I understand Java is good like uh  
a cross-platform language but since this is hosted 
in the cloud uh is there like a benefit from  
having still Java or just to be compatible with 
sqx uh well as you say it is in a cloud and uh  
there is a some advantage to use using JavaScript 
not the Java the pure Java it can be written also  
in pure Java but it comes with some uh some 
disadvantages that we didn't want to to have so  
so we we did it in a different language for the 
cloud I mean that will bring us to Jan uh Jan
is the you are in the marketing basically I would 
just slightly correct you not only marketing but  
also and let's say business development of things 
which is a very very tough and very challenging a  
few words regarding myself uh if I remember 
correctly I joined the company in 2016 so in  
similar times as Cornell and so it's been more 
like more than six years so far and well I can  
say that since then the company grew very very 
very rapidly uh we welcomed new colleagues we  
established a lot of business Partnerships around 
the globe including you we basically entered new  
markets and released new strategy Quant X and 
now I'm really looking forward to launch the  
algo Cloud which we will for sure discuss more in 
detail within this this meeting yeah so I I can  
say it was it was a hell of a ride you know but I 
I I sense that a lot of potential down the road yeah  
the ups and downs of software development I've 
lived through that about 10 years ago and it's  
not nice which I guess Mark uh did you imagine 
that your company will reach the stage like  
this was the goal from the beginning or are you 
surprised by the growth of strategy context well  
yeah I'm not I was not expecting anything really 
I was just looking forward to to see where it goes  
where it will and I'm still looking forward where 
it goes because this is not the end for us uh we  
are just uh I would say we are in the beginning 
still so I'm I'm really glad I appreciate many  
users that uh that use our products and they are 
satisfied with with it uh but uh I would like to  
grow more still so this growth brought to many 
users uh can you share with us the size of your  
company the size of your user base a company is 
about 20 people now which consists of like nine  
programmers for people for support free strategy 
developers free people for marketing and business  
development and as for users uh we have a well I 
think last time I I checked it we had almost 200  
000 users people who at least once used 
one of our products either paid or free  
and not all of them are using the the software 
all the time but we have about a few thousand of  
uh paying uh static one users or people who bought 
the license then there's a big group of people who  
use our free products and you sell your software 
globally so yes yes we are a global content well  
what do you say the biggest user base U.S by 
far then we have strong persons in European  
countries obviously ours the Czech Republic but 
Italy is pretty big in terms of customer base  
Germany and I'm I'm very happy to say that Spain 
is very very getting getting out of pace recently  
and also I would like to add that we are pretty 
strong in Asian countries thanks to our business  
partners for example in Singapore in in Taiwan 
uh and like I said I'm pretty happy that we are  
rapidly growing in in Spain and less Latin America 
in general and also in the Middle East countries  
which is very interesting but this is primaries 
thanks to our very very dedicated Partners who are  
really contributing with very valuable educational 
content in in Spanish or Arabic respectively and  
also the thing I would like to to add is that 
we are seeing a great uh progress in in Brazil  
where we are setting up a partnership with very 
experienced and dedicated team of professionals  
and this step also obviously requires a lot of 
adjustments needed to be done on our side of  
strategic one as a software especially in regards 
to to support of for example local market data  
because we need to you know obviously have support 
for the local local markets local indices dollar  
Index and so on so yeah this is very challenging 
honestly but hopefully we will deal with this and  
we will get started there pretty soon obviously 
big growth is very nice for a business but also  
comes with its own challenges and I'm sure just 
like you said you have hundreds of thousands of  
users that's really hard to support and answer 
questions and attempt to requested features  
it's what would you say or from your data what 
is what is the hardest thing for users to use  
your software what is the most sticking points 
that comes up most of the time that you see  
it probably depends on on the type of user 
but I would say from from what I experience  
uh one of the biggest challenges is uh uh or 
biggest complaints or biggest problems that  
we need to solve is that uh users sometimes 
don't get the same results in StrategyQuant and  
their target trading platform metatrader 
or tradestation on multicharge usually  
this is uh just an incorrect setup different 
something different setup in strategic one  
compared to the trading platform but this is 
something that every new user has to really  
um be careful of and make sure that 
his data or his strategies match  
in the in the static one and his Target platform 
this is a problem of course I face this also  
it's because you're always trying to interpret 
the other engines and how they do their thing  
on on your engine and of course they are using 
different data provider this I I say this to  
all my community all the time that this is never 
going to end unless of course the route you took  
which it's a great thing because that was my 
I think the first time I talked with John we  
discussed this is the first the best thing to do 
is that you take your own strategy and your engine  
and connect uh to your own broker or your partner 
broker which you went through that route and I'll  
go Cloud which we'll discuss later so I think 
that's the solution for this problem other than  
that what do you think the uh the most requested 
features from your user base globally is there a  
common theme that they want I don't really think 
there is some some feature top three features that  
are most requested I don't uh recall anything 
like this every every person wants something  
else and depending on his level and expertise they 
won't either something simpler or something more  
advanced and everybody thinks his own future is 
the most important and most uh uh like critical so  
we have to also prioritize because these resources 
are limited of course we cannot do everything  
and we cannot just make the software extremely 
complex to add everything so so we need we need to  
prioritize to make it simple and easy to use like 
you mentioned you started this uh 10 11 years ago  
and you started to program things to do things for 
you now you're running huge company huge user base  
do you still trade do you have time actually 
to trade uh not really because uh as you said  
I'm I'm running a company and uh and I have to 
do a lot of things so I'm not really trading uh  
I started uh when my first my trading Journey 
started with the uh Futures actually the maybe  
the one of the hardest instruments or assets 
uh with the intraday trading of Futures which  
means sitting in front of the computer for a few 
days when marketing is open and and the trading  
15-minute charts or five minute charts so this 
is what I started with and I definitely don't  
have time for this and I don't have the patience 
for this anymore right now I'm committed to Argo  
trading so I am trading only algorithmically I'm 
not really developing my own strategies right now  
we are developing the new stocks stock trading 
strategies as a team and we are developing our new  
platform algo Cloud exactly for this to be able to 
trade this kind of uh trading strategies now that  
you mentioned algo let's get into it what is algo 
Cloud what's the difference between algo cloud and  
strategy context oh okay algo cloud is our new 
uh Cloud trading platform something to trade our  
new class of strategies that was introduced in 
the latest strategic one version for stocks for  
now it is only for stocks trading and for stock 
picking engine and single stock strategies that  
we can develop using static wand so 
this is a platform where you can easily  
upload or even create in our Cloud create a 
created strategy using a built-in editor and  
then just deploy it connect it to your broker and 
trade it so currently the strategy is built using  
the Builder and strategy context can be ported to 
algo Cloud to be traded on autopilot basically on  
VPS which is your running uh I noticed that the 
custom blocks is not there yet so I'm assuming  
this is a yeah this is coming in in the future 
and as I said other cloud is for for stocks for  
equities only for now this is the beginning the 
advantage of course is like we mentioned earlier  
is that there is no interpretation between two 
engines and two data that is your data your engine  
so there is no mismatch between the results of 
tragic context and algo Cloud they should yes  
this is one of the big biggest advantages and 
another thing is I would like to point out that  
uh without uh other Cloud there simply is not a 
simple way to trade this kind of strategies I'm  
talking about the stock picking type of strategies 
because we internally in as a team who are trading  
this kind of strategies not just myself but also 
my colleagues and it is very difficult we have to  
use Python scripts complicated setups on VPS and 
so on and it was very error prone and problematic  
so without algo Cloud there wasn't a simple way 
of trading these kind of strategies and this is  
why generally we created our Cloud to be able 
to trade this kind of strategies with basically  
for the users who don't know this you can rank 
thousands of stocks and on a criteria and then  
you apply your logic to the top ranking the stocks 
and this is not available in retail and if it is  
it's on back testing only uh nothing like what 
you're offering right now I'm really excited about  
this not because I'm interviewing you but really 
this is also very exciting news for me the but the  
only thing missing for me is future so is Future's 
coming to this platform well my idea is that in  
the future this will be a full featured trading 
platform so it will create Futures Forex crypto  
even uh but uh we have to start with something 
it is really a lot of work to implement stocks  
so we already almost finished with stocks and 
uh we'll see where we'll go from here because  
uh there are many ways where this project where 
this platform can go and it would depend also on  
what our users would want so if you have uh enough 
people interested in Futures We'll add Futures  
next if it is Forex or crypto or something else 
or another stock engine it would be this so we'll  
see the goal is make sure that everybody wants 
you you vote for futures right okay yes okay I  
think really the advantage of course stocks 
don't get me wrong it's a different assets  
and it's extremely liquid you can think a lot of 
money into it but really for me Futures although  
it's difficult to implement I can understand 
you have expiry different expiries and different  
session times and so on but the diversification 
they offer you is huge and more and more markets  
Futures Market coming in but I understand it 
could be maybe the second step after stocks  
and of course I don't trade Forex but I'm sure 
Forex will be there because they are the easiest  
I guess well yeah probably second easiest of the 
stocks do you want to share anything else for algo  
Cloud what's your partner do you plan to be your 
own broker I know you're partnering with alpaca to  
uh trade to interactive brokers correct we 
are alpaca this was the very first partner  
we addressed and then we also uh connected to 
interactive brokers as you say and uh yeah there  
are more to come you know still even we are in 
let's say development phase and I'm also seeing  
a requests from our let's say parking brokerages 
who wants to you know chat about that whether they  
can be involved in this so let's see how it goes 
but I think I maybe the thing I want to add is in  
regards to let's say I'll go Cloud to compare to 
to strategic one you know I mean this is something  
we were we were let's say missing I mean the 
execution part it was the only missing uh piece in  
the puzzle so basically we wanted to fix this uh 
with with a algor cloud and uh I think I'm really  
looking forward to to get it started because the 
smartest side this is something that basically  
we have everything under one roof you know we 
have strategies creation development we have  
optimization and and uh let's say back testing 
uh included in strategy Quant and now the missing  
piece is the execution where we can seamlessly 
connect the strategies to algo cloud and either  
use the strategies generated in strategy Quant or 
and which is also my favorite part of this we can  
let users just decide what strategies I mean the 
stock picking strategies for now they can they can  
select from the pre-selected let's say template 
and get get started you know so as you as you  
can imagine I mean you are a pro right but think 
about the newbies the new traders who are uh who  
see strategic one for for the very first time uh 
they they are they are puzzled it's very complex  
Flex tool they need to learn a lot they need 
to you know get much get as much information  
they can as they can in order to to even Master 
it so to to deal with it and now they what they  
they go to algo Cloud they just log in and they 
can easily just press the button and connect with  
their brokerage account and they're they're good 
to go I think users today don't know how yeah good  
they have it because uh of course I'm a strategy 
context user it is frustrating like all software  
people don't understand they think there is a 
perfect soft there is no such thing it's just  
like you said it's impossible to please everybody 
but I think the step you took now this is a huge  
step that people don't appreciate the value 
because you took all the complications away  
running a VPS making sure your software is always 
up to date in the cloud alerts reporting and then  
just taking the same strategy that you build 
not worrying about where it's going to execute  
broker side and all there are so many things 
in execution this is now not development even  
if you develop the best strategy you still have a 
bunch of headaches just to execute that strategy  
correctly every time so of course I understand 
this most professional not professional even most  
let's say uh experienced users knows this but for 
newbies just like you say yeah this is huge this  
is huge for everybody because you're taking a lot 
of headache out of it and I mentioned this many  
times I'm looking really looking forward to start 
this and I think I'm receiving now emails from  
I'll go Cloud that just means that it's running 
now because I've been receiving this for a couple  
of weeks now so I'm assuming you are running now 
correct it is running still in a better version we  
are testing and finishing the last things there 
when do you think you will uh launch let's say  
with real trading for maybe a small subset of 
users do you think you'll do this soon well  
yes we are recording this in April so our plan is 
to have a public beta version better testing the  
next month so which is May and depending on how 
well it will go and what it will show us we might  
start having a real public launch month after that 
or two months after depending really on on what  
we'll find I think you are under version last I 
downloaded I think one three seven rc1 is that uh  
is that the one that's going to take 
those strategies to I'll go cloud
um uh actually we released the rc2 today just 
today but uh I'm not sure what you what do you  
mean do you mean that if yeah so I mean you can 
use 137 to export the strategies to algo Cloud  
yeah you can do it you can you don't need to 
export it you just take the the sqx file of the  
strategy and uh then you can import or upload 
it to algo cloud and it would it would run the  
strategy context is a data mining package you can 
use it to build your own strategies on autopilot  
using your own instructions or literally you 
can build strategies manually using a graphical  
interface you can download a free fully functional 
versions that work for 14 days and if you decide  
to buy it you can use my coupons stat Oasis to get 
23 of their published price you have two versions  
last time I saw four the stock engine one is for 
single stock and one for ranking multiple stocks  
why why the difference between these two is it 
like a like some in the structure something in the  
structure or yeah they are quite different because 
Coral will probably explain it better later but uh  
we started with the stock picker engine which 
is a engine that trades group of stocks like S  
P 500 or 500 all 500 stocks in the index and it 
does it as you briefly mentioned it by ranking  
all the stocks and applying the criteria and 
choosing a top X stocks to trade at the given day  
and the other approach is a single stock approach 
where you trade just one single stock and it is  
very similar to trading Forex or Futures just 
one asset with a momentum strategy or breakout  
studies or whatever so those are quite different 
approaches and each of them has its own advantages  
and disadvantages probably everyone knows those 
strategies for S P 500 or ETF spy where you for  
example buy when the market drops and the seller 
when it goes back and simply there are quite many  
simple Concepts in Market or some seasonality 
Santa Claus really Etc and simply we needed some  
tool which can trade them but obviously we are 
ranking so the template let's say the template  
or structure or the of the strategy is slightly 
different therefore we call it or name it like  
single stock strategy it can be also single ETF 
strategy or CDF for example now for the 60 broker  
and then there is uh this part of the this 
stock picking where you have the ranking and  
then as you cannot get out from the structure 
this there will there will be always ranking  
and there you will always trade like the group of 
stocks what will happen if you have two strategies  
trading the same instrument like uh is that 
possible to want to go long and one short or both  
long will the engine deal with that sure yeah we 
have uh like uh we have um I will maybe not answer  
all those like exact exact how it goes the process 
but the basically we simulate all those situations  
like long short above the same symbol and the 
other and other normal situations and uh basically  
we have some rules for example the simple rule 
if the ranking will be always one which might  
happen the indicator will return always one so 
the ranking is off then the strategy will be  
ranked based on the name of the stock so it will 
work and so as we are developing this project this  
project for probably for two years right now so 
yeah we are thinking about the strategies about  
those situations uh because there are like many 
of them you know and this is also great about  
this project and I also created ebook for users 
and they simply don't need to care about this so  
if you have one strategy coming along one going 
short will that be uh the stocks are not like  
like Forex where you can have a open position to 
long and short at the same time so uh we have to  
obey how Brokers really work with stocks so as 
you said we can have a if there is strategy that  
trades One stock and another strategy that trades 
the same stock if they go long both of them at the  
same time then then just two positions of the 
stocks will be opened if one goes long and the  
other goes short then the first one is opened the 
other one is ignored this is one of the beauties  
of the stock picking approach that when you have 
to skip this one of the symbols because of this  
because it the the the stock is taken by another 
strategy you have still maybe another few strategy  
another few symbols and a few stocks that you can 
trade so yeah you can always fill the slot you're  
not depending on a single symbol uh do you think 
at one point you will uh I know probably this is  
a company secret but do you think you will be your 
own broker something like tradestation where you  
are the platform the engine the execution well 
we don't have any plans for becoming a broker  
for now but who who knows what will what will 
happen in the future well only exactly as Mara  
said basically there are many paths we can follow 
so brokerage is one of them but honestly uh it's  
not it's not something we are dealing with right 
now uh honestly with algo Cloud you would love  
to connect as many brokerages as we can uh to our 
how Google Cloud solution and so that would as we  
said assure that basically anyone can can use Ogle 
Cloud to execute their trades properly on their  
trading accounts with their favorite brokerage 
and yeah obviously the more Brokers we connect  
the more customers we can get from all around the 
world and uh yeah this is this is the path we are  
following in let's say the short term who knows 
what's going to happen in long term no usually the  
the problem with users is you need to figure 
out the API and the connection and since you  
are doing that part for users it should be very 
easy I'll pick my best broker and it's connected  
uh I don't need to worry about the technical part 
of it one of the drawbacks of doing everything  
algorithmically is we don't care as much about 
charting but it is still an important part do  
you think it's possible or sometimes in the future 
you have it in your plans to connect to a charting  
platform like something like trading View through 
an API or give that option to users or is that  
not on the on the road plan well we already have 
some some basic charting in both static ones and  
algo Cloud where you can see traits on charts 
in static one including all the indicators and  
the values that are used when evaluating the the 
rules on every bar so this is already there and  
we'll see if the users will want it I don't 
see why we shouldn't edit but for now I don't  
release well well if if you see I mean okay 
you can you have to you can persuade me but if  
you see the trades and charts as you see them on 
strategy Quant I don't know do you need another uh  
another trading view or some other account to see 
them as a developer of strategies and I'm sure  
most of them most users who develop strategies 
will attest to this you need some confirmation  
that the strategy it's doing what it's 
supposed to do so for example if you  
want to enter on I don't know let's say 
close plus ATR percentage you want to know  
that yes you are entering on that correctly 
or maybe next day or at 10 am whatever it is  
and I guess the the feedback which is either 
charting or debugging the code is the only two  
things you have and since we are in I'll go visit 
the whole point is not to program so I guess the  
only thing left is charting and if it's an option 
it's just like you're connecting to brokers  
I think this will add a lot of value to sqx I mean 
I'm sure this is an internal decision inside your  
company uh there are two things first uh as you 
said the starting and debugging we we are adding  
or we already added uh like debugging part of the 
of this for stock picking engine and for single  
stocks engine strategies into strategic one and 
also into other Cloud so you will be able to see  
daily on every bar what were the values for 
every symbol and if if the rules matched  
what were the exact values of each indicator 
in the in the entry on NX rule so this would  
be something that you would be able so that's the 
log you're talking about correct log and there is  
also one configure which which of the indicators 
you want to see which of the values you want to  
see and so that you are not overwhelmed with 
everything but just to get what you see and the  
other thing the charting uh I don't really see the 
the importance of adding trading view because as  
I said there is a charting in study count and it 
does exactly what you want it seems to me because  
it shows you trades on the charts it shows a bar 
for every day and it's obviously the indicators  
values so so you can find if you want to verify 
that the strategy trades according to the rules  
you can do it in our charting uh basically as Mark 
told there is a lock or in stock picking where you  
see like day by day the open trade close trade and 
Etc but then then recently we added the function  
where for example the strategy opens when three 
conditions are met let's say and we can lock the  
state of every single condition for every single 
day so this is what we can do now that that when  
you turn this option on and then in this special 
table you will see state of every single condition  
and see like as days are going which are which 
conditions are met so this is something we edited  
recently just exactly because this comes from 
developer strategy developers who is responsible  
for the engine because simply when he tried to 
make it like the let's say bug free you need it to  
some kind of debugging so for his own purposes he 
developed this lock nizlock and his Explorer and  
Explorer and functionality and now it is possible 
into very detailey I think it comes with the new  
version of strategy Quant I think it was not 
in previous one it comes with the version and  
it allows very detailey to debug to the back the 
state of every single condition and every other  
values you will put into this Explorer or lock so 
I want to jump now to Quant analyzer the neglected  
child as I'd like to call it as as one analyzer 
getting more resources I mean I would love to see  
how we can have let's say the same practice the 
same retesting the robustness testing of strategy  
Quant X implemented in a Quant analyzer so we can 
do it on a portfolio level do you have any plans  
for a Quant analyzer well yeah it is connected 
to the fact that we have a limited resources we  
are a small company still small company many 
projects to develop so we were focusing very  
hard on the tragic one and the stock picking 
engine and the cloud platform so we were kind  
of neglecting quantalizer last year but we want 
to keep on developing it so I hope we'll get to  
it this year and uh as for your question not 
everything can be done in a quantizer because  
some things can be done only when you really 
back test the things when you run back to send  
strategy and the con artist doesn't run like 
this so it cannot just rerun the strategy with  
some different data or different setting it 
can work only with the results produced by  
something else some things that are in Quant 
advisor more advanced things like portfolio  
master and these kind of things can be added to 
study Quant that would be the best feature to  
add instead of having a separate platform which 
is Quant analyzer if you just add the portfolio  
part to sqx yeah we'll see we are still deciding 
what will be the some new major features for the  
next build of tragic land or next two builds so 
we plan to discuss with the with the users and  
and if this is something that it would be very 
important for all of them and we can we can do  
it just small additional we are also planning to 
other more portfolio functions into algo cloud  
because right now there is like this part 
for strategy development that is part for  
running the strategies and let's say we have 
quite good strategies already but obviously  
there there is some work remaining in putting 
those strategies together and obviously that  
could not be quite easy task as you have some 
dedicated capital and some strategies you know  
running together or separately you know like 
involve your Capital as the best way possible  
so this is like remaining step we need we need 
to implement and we need to from the beginning  
we'll add it back and we'll just Implement 
some kind of simple portfolio simulator but  
later as we have control over everything and 
we can Implement some more advanced portfolio  
portfolio let's say managing functions for 
example we can involve like the volatility  
of the strategy or every strategy will work well 
and we'll put more weight for it or more capital  
and if this strategy don't perform very 
well we can we can put like the position  
size down and it's very simple and but it 
works well so now we have control over this  
and this is something we are planning to add to 
algo Cloud as we have all tools we need it's just  
um this will be well one of the features like 
future task regarding the portfolio but obviously  
it's just additional the quantum laser will 
be there also that's amazing because what you  
said is exactly what I'm looking for which is 
to rank strategies and allocate Capital to the  
best strategies just like we're ranking stocks on 
certain criteria and we're investing in certain  
stocks we can do the same thing to strategies 
and again just for users who are hearing this  
for the first time this is not available on retail 
packages anywhere and uh not even offline I mean  
you cannot just you cannot do this right now you 
need to build your own python code yeah and uh at  
least that's what I'm doing so it's great to hear 
that you have this uh in your future plans so sqx  
uses some kind of machine learning I guess to come 
up with the best strategy to fit those criterias  
and we can say machine learning is some kind of 
AI and of course AI since last November just came  
out of nowhere and and uh just it's everywhere 
you cannot get away from it do you think that  
maybe in couple of years you know you have 100 
000 users building strategies so the data you  
will have so much that you can maybe even use 
AI to build better strategies in your software  
that's one and question two do you think we will 
need something like sqx in 5-10 years or we will  
all just be sitting and ordering our AI to build 
strategies and leave it uh it is very hard to it  
is very hard to um somehow guess what will happen 
in the future uh one thing about this is that even  
though we have a lot of users and so if if we 
have a lot of users it would be not that simple  
to to share their data because of a privacy and 
ownership I don't think that many users would  
what would uh agree to sharing their strategies 
with some some data engine in order to improve  
strategies of somebody else so I'm not sure 
if it could be used like this what about do  
you think AI in five years it will have enough 
data from the market enough power computer power  
that it can I don't know easily come up with 
strategies and test the robustness without you  
uh like basically you like it's 
basically sqx on steroids do you think  
that will happen or do you think your company 
sqx will have that built in at some point I mean  
I know this is all future things but what's your 
opinion well my my estimation is that it would not  
be like this that those large language models 
are not really suited for this kind of things  
that it would be probably used for improving the 
strategies probably for easily translating studies  
from one language to another maybe adding 
some some smaller thanks to the strategy  
but not to research and develop a new strategies 
but uh we'll see I might be wrong about this  
we are all watching the the AI and I'm 
always thinking how to use it in trading  
uh but for now I think there isn't really an 
application of the new AI models directly to  
trading and we also don't see something something 
in this in this area for now if I if I might  
add uh well I'll it's your first question uh 
regarding the use of the data I think it's a  
very tough question I mean uh we would definitely 
need to take AI into account but there might be  
some issues with privacy and ownership like Mario 
said and I completely agree with that so I think  
that instead of relying just on AI Insurance of 
overall strategic creation or development I'm  
more thinking of AI implementation the form for 
example for for seasonality uh models or earnings  
models or using AI basically as a filter for some 
fundamental news and so on so basically I think  
it might be actually an excellent add-on to to 
algocom out you know to to use the AI models you  
know to filter uh various things you know and in 
regards to your second question uh to whether we  
would become obsolete uh well I think nobody knows 
let's get a crystal ball right but uh for sure I'm  
confident that AI will play a far more dominant 
role in our lives and everyday activities trading  
investing included of course and uh for sure this 
is something we will need to to face to deal with  
and as we mentioned before uh I think we we see 
a great use of AI uh in regards to some I'll say  
improvements of data models as you suggested or 
macroeconomic news or fundamentals or basically  
evaluation of corresponding Market behavior before 
or afterwards once there is some fundamentals  
announced so so let's see but also I expect the 
uh translation as Moro said of coding languages  
from one to another that is going to be a matter 
of a few few seconds or a second so it might I  
think facilitate say the little things for for 
us as all good Traders you know so but you know  
from from a broader perspective obviously with 
or without AI I'm talking in general right the  
goal of trading or Investments is always the same 
you know to to make money right so I'm I'm really  
confident that the main principle will be the same 
you know whether AI or or not you know so this is  
this is uh uh I'm also very positive that uh we 
will not be hopefully replaced by by AI but for  
us it will be more like a benefit I mean we will 
benefit from from AI uh rather than going to be  
replaced by AI right so all in all it's gonna 
be very challenging task not only for Traders  
and investors but I think in for for humans in 
general so let's see what's oh wait how it turns  
out I think it's just another tool and you will 
still need at the end a human behind that tool  
to instructed directed develop it but definitely 
it will make a lot of things easier for us  
and I've seen 10 years ago I had the chance 
to see this end practice in a hedge fund  
but there are still two people behind it directing 
this AI what to do I mean the only difference it  
was doing it you know once they told the AI what 
to do it was doing it a hundred times faster no  
emotions and the advantages that comes with it 
I so I agree with you it's a tool and hopefully  
you'll be alive 10 years to get back to this 
I think you are really doing a wonderful job  
with strategy context I know there are a lot of 
frustrations I have a lot of frustration with  
strategy context but having developed a software 
before I know how difficult the job is and it's  
people don't understand it's not about money 
and resources I mean yes it's an important part  
but really managing all these pieces and 
bringing them together it's not an easy task  
and I mean we can look at the Apple a two trillion 
dollar company and they have bugs in their  
software so you can imagine uh it's it's not easy 
but I like the courage that you have that you are  
forging in this path alone you'll be the leader 
in this hopefully a successful reader reader that  
will benefit all of us the Traders globally who do 
you think your competition is or do you even think  
about them or you just uh you have your blindfolds 
forging straightforward you don't care about what  
everything else is happening uh or do you really 
look at what's happening in the space or I think  
competition is uh is a good for customers and 
not good for us as company it would be best for  
us if we have a monopoly on everything but I'm a 
Believer in free market and competition is what  
drives quality up so we have to deal with it and 
uh we are aware of competitions there are some  
companies that started just in the recent years 
but I personally don't watch it that closely I saw  
what each of them did when when I somehow found 
out about them but uh I'm not watching it closely  
watching every feature they they do every product 
on the market has some strong and weak points  
depends on where he is going and which kind of 
which direction because there are many directions  
but you can go and I think strategy Quant is a way 
ahead in many important areas there is nothing in  
the other products like study templates or custom 
project workflows and we are not just the software  
but we have a whole educational ecosystem so we 
don't just offer product but we can accompanied  
with the education and now we are starting to 
uh adding uh we are starting to add also the  
execution with the ago Cloud platform so I think 
we are developing in a direction where the others  
are not and they might have some strong points in 
other parts but nothing as as we we are the best I  
agree with that that's the right attitude to have 
I I can I have an analogy on my YouTube channel I  
used to look at other YouTube channels and think 
oh man they are producing crap and and they have  
more subscribers and then I said okay forget 
everybody else just focus on what you're doing  
and I think that's the right attitude to have I 
you should think that you are the best and just go  
on your own path and forget everybody else I mean 
it's nice to look every now and then of what's  
happening in the market but really your first step 
I mean everybody now is watching you about this  
step and uh how will you will cope with the demand 
and I think they will copy you because this is big  
this is a huge I want to thank you very much for 
doing this really this has been a great insight  
into the inner working of strategy context I wish 
you the best of luck I know there are competition  
but as I always say you are the best value for 
money because of what you said because of all  
the things that comes with the sqx and I hope to 
see you again maybe in six months we'll see how  
I'll go cloud is doing thank you thank you so 
much Ellie for having us it was a pleasure as  
always and yeah we'll be looking forward to repeat 
this interview say in six months as you suggested  
so let's see then right for more interviews 
watch this video and I will see you then
