but this is only 60 trades so 60 trades
but each trade is more than five times
the average trade of the RSI 2. so while
they look the same the numbers tell a
different story also the percent of when
here is 74 while here is 82 percent
so while we are making less money not a
lot less but we are making less money
and higher drawdown but we are making it
with a lot less trades and a higher win
rate
