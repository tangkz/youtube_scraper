the pattern is extremely simple where we
are waiting for a pullback then we buy
it and we exit when it makes a higher
high now there is nothing new so far
because this pattern existed for the
longest time I mean the mirror version
strategy on the US indexes and in any
trading platform you can change the S P
500 symbol and put Apple or Google or
Microsoft or whatever stock you like the
robustness come from Trading hundreds of
stock at the same time the problem is
there is not enough Capital to trade all
these stocks of course unless you are
hedge fund then it's totally okay and
the other problem is having the platform
to test a portfolio of stocks using a
single pattern
