about 10 years ago through my research
on the S P 500 I found a small Edge and
I built a trading strategy around it
that I used to trade it manually the
strategy is still profitable today and
in fact it's still part of a big
portfolio that I have that trades
automatically today in this video I will
show you how to find such edges in every
market and how to build strategies
around it and trade them in a portfolio
