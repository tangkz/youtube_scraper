but now that we have generated two
separate strategies from this indicator
using totally different fundamental
reason one is going with the trend one
is going against the trend theoretically
we can combine those two strategies on
the same instrument and we should get
better numbers so here I did an
optimization for both strategies on the
S P 500 you can see this is strategy one
and this is strategy two so optimize the
look back period the overbought and the
oversaw with total number of
optimizations of 345
000 strategy so first thing if we sold
by net profit we can see that all
strategies are profitable more than 329
000 strategies
of course this doesn't cut it because
it's 9000 net profit and no commission
no slippage so this is a losing strategy
